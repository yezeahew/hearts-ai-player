-- | Play function type.

-- Cards are added to each trick from the front.  Thus, the first-played card
-- in a trick is the last in its list of cards The lead suit is the suit of the
-- first-played card in the trick.  A play is only legal if it does not reneg
-- on the lead suit.  That is, the player must play a card of the suit led if
-- they have it.  The winner is the highest trump card (if any were legally
-- played), or, if no trumps were played, the highest card in the lead suit.
